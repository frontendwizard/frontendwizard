# Juliano Farias - @frontendwizard - üßôüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I know, big username right? Well, I grew up reading stories about magical universes and dimensions and programming was the way I found to do some magic and build cool shit. You can find me on twitter ([@frontendwizard](https://twitter.com/frontendwizard)) or [twitch](https://twitch.tv/frontendwizard) where I occasionally stream while working on open source projects and live coding fun stuff.

I'm mostly doing React related stuff, with some data visualizations and a whole lot of other small pieces and libraries of the frontend ecosystem.

I'm currently working as a Frontend Engineer at [Ingka Group Digital](https://github.com/ingka-group-digital/). You can find all the work experiences and professional information on [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/frontendwizard).
